- 👋 Hi, I’m @timespaceimage
- 👀 I’m interested in electronic music and art; also topics such as multimedia, copywriting, digital currency, and NFTs - and how we can apply them in practical ways towards cultural and individual expression as well as create meaningful connections.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Balloon Catz
